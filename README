This dataset contains reconstructed, unprocessed MRI data accompanying the
paper titled "Deciphering the scopolamine challenge rat model by preclinical
functional MRI". Experiment 1 was conducted on subjects 1-18, and experiment 2
on subjects 19-34. Each rat underwent multiple sessions (4 and 3 sessions in
experiment 1 and 2 respectively) and were pretreated with either i.p.
scopolamine, butyl scopolamine, donepezil (only in experiment 1), or saline
buffer in a randomized cross-over design. They were anesthetised in either
isoflurane or in a combination of isoflurane and i.p.  medetomidine. For
functional assessment, whisker stimulation was used with an air puff aimed at
the right whisker pad. Functional scans were acquired with either gradient echo
EPI, spin echo EPI or multislice FAIR-ASL. Resting state scans were also
acquired but are not discussed in the paper. While we publish this dataset as
one BIDS project, it is recommended to slice this dataset into 2 BIDS
compatible datasets and handle the 2 experiments separetely during processing,
as there are substantial differences (eg.: number of sessions, sequences).
